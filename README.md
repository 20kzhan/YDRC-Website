# Teacher Guide
Getting accepted to become a teacher can take minutes to days, depending on when you submit the request. 

Once approved, you can make your own classes and see students that enroll in them.

If you're a student and also a teacher, there is a "Switch to Student" button in the top right. Functionally, you have two accounts.
